    "This is a vertically oriented watercolor painting on paper that you could hold in your hand. In its center, dominating the top two thirds, a sturdy tree spreads its leafy branches, forming a pyramidal canopy. Sitting under the tree are two figures: an ash-covered ascetic leans on his armrest, seating on an animal skin, head bowed in thought, with his youthful disciple seated opposite on a tiger skin, playing a stringed instrument (rudra vina). It is night time, but the sky is cool, covered in starts and a crescent moon while the springy earth echoes that of the leaves above. The delicate tonal range and precise brushwork evoke a fleeting fragility appropriate to the musical poetic mode depicted in this Kedar Ragini album page by the Indian artist Ruknuddin.",
